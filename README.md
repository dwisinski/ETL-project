# ETL-project

by: Dave Wisinski

May 2021

## Description:
This project was created to demonstrate a number of ETL concepts by utilizing a variety of web sources (in .csv format) which were loaded, cleaned and transformed using pandas DataFrames in a Jupyter Notebook. The resulting DataFrames were loaded/exported to a SQLite database where they can be joined/queried using traditional SQLite queries, or read back to DataFrames from the database.

## Notes:

All source data .csv files are located in the source_data folder.
