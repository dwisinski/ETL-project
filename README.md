May 2021

## Description:
This project was created to demonstrate a number of ETL concepts by utilizing a variety of web sources which were cleaned/transformed using pandas DataFrames in a Jupyter Notebook. The resulting DataFrames were loaded/exported to a SQLite database where they can be queried using traditional SQLite queries, or read back to DataFrames from the database.
